      p(class='subheading') What Is a Loan?
      p(class='text') A loan is an agreement where a lender gives money to a borrower with the understanding that it will be paid back later, usually with interest. Loans are commonly used to cover costs that people cannot afford to pay all at once, such as buying a car, paying for education, or covering medical bills.
