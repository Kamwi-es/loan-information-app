      p(class='subheading') Some common risks include:
      p(class='text') •	Overborrowing: Taking more than you can afford to repay.
      p(class='text') •	Predatory Lending: Some lenders charge extremely high fees and trap borrowers in cycles of debt.
      p(class='text') •	Late Payments and Defaults: This can damage your credit score and lead to legal action.
      p(class='text')  NB: Always read the full loan agreement and ask questions before signing.

      p(class='text') Key Risks of Borrowing: 
      p(class='subheading') 1.  Repayment Risk
      p(class='text') - If your income falls or expenses rise unexpectedly, you may struggle to make repayments.
      p(class='text') - Missed payments can lead to late fees, penalty interest rates, and damage to your credit score.
      p(class='text')
      p(class='subheading') 2.  Interest Rate Risk
      p(class='text') - Variable-rate loans can become more expensive if interest rates rise.
      p(class='text') - Even small increases can make repayments significantly higher over time
      p(class='text')
      p(class='subheading') 3.  Over-Indebtedness
      p(class='text') - Borrowing too much can trap you in a cycle where you are borrowing more just to keep up with existing debt repayments
      p(class='text') - This reduces financial flexibility and increases stress.
      p(class='text')
      p(class='subheading') 4.  Hidden Costs
      p(class='text') - Some loans have origination fees, early repayment penalties, insurance add-ons, or mandatory account fees that make the real cost higher than it first appears.
      p(class='text')
      p(class='text') 5.  Asset Loss
      p(class='text') - Secured loans (like mortgages or auto loans) use your property as collateral therefore if you default, you risk repossession.
      p(class='text') 
      p(class='subheading') Warning Signs to Watch Out For
      p(class='text') - Repayments exceed 30–40% of your monthly income (including mortgages and all other debts).
      p(class='text') - You are using new loans to repay old ones.
      p(class='text') - Your emergency savings are shrinking just to keep up with repayments.
      p(class='text') - The loan contract has complex or unclear terms so if you don’t understand them fully, you may be agreeing to more risk than you realise.
      p(class='text') 
      p(class='subheading') Safer Borrowing Practices
      p(class='text') - Borrow only for needs, not wants, and for amounts you can realistically repay even if your circumstances change.
      p(class='text') - Prefer fixed interest rates
      p(class='text') - Compare multiple lenders and read the full terms before signing.
      p(class='text') - Check your credit report regularly.
